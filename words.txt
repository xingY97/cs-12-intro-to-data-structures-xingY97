Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me
And we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting
I promise I'm changing
I just need
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case drive you up the wall when I'm workin'
Actually I'm prolly worse when I'm not you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do I say something that hurts you
Actin' like I'm gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you're at the end of your road
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
That's just the pride talkin' isn't it cause both of us know
I'm the definition of wreck if you look into my soul
Comes out the most
When I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes
I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid
Might get distant, and I push you away
But no matter the case
I'ma do whatever it takes
Even if
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me
And we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting
I promise I'm changing
I just need time
I, I need time
I just need time
I, I need time
Time, time
Yeah
Way before I bought you the ring
We were fightin' back and forth like you were wearing the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life over analyzing everything
Always depressed tryn to find a better version of me
Searchin' for somethin' I knows prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me?
Maybe not but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues I'm tryna work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doing
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowin' that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
A lot of regrets
I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant
To do
You know I love you to death
Even if
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me
And we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting
I promise I'm changing
I just need time
I, I need time
I just need time
I, I need time
Time, time
I just need time
I, I need time
I just need time
I, I need time
Time, time
